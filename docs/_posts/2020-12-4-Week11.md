At the start of this week we handed our sprint 2 game in. I think that overall we did quite good although we had issues in our group that meant that we had to only have one level this was not a real issue as every part of the game technically was working it was just the game wasnt as long as it was originally thaught by us.

There was no lecture this week and In the workshop we had a guest lecturer from waving bear studios who came and talked to us about thair experiences in thair company as they are a relitively new startup and stuffed which is thair game that we were able to play is thair first game as the studio. They are based in falmouth and are doing quite well it seems, they have invited anyone who wants to go and visit the studio and also mentioned that they are looking to expand thair team. I asume by saying that they are looking at us as potential employees that could join the studio although im not sure if I would want to work in a start-up, I dont like the potential risk involved but it could be a good oppertunity if it prosents itself. The game that they were showing was really good they have put a lot of effort into the asthetic of the game and the way that the guns feel are really nice. It also appeals to my more gameplay oriented mind where the game feels nice to play, there were a few issuew with the game such as the stairs being slippery but overall it felt really nice to play.

In the peer review session that was today there was not that many people there so the results of which game was the best was not done by that many people and I was also not able to play all the games as I needed a covid test in order to go home for christmas but the final result of which game was the best was a game called rain boy which I have not been able to play.
