In the lecture this week we were talking about creativity something I personally am not great at as I don’t think that I am a very creative person. The lecture outlined what different people believe that creativity is to them and that creativity is very different depending on who you are. I think that the most interesting part of this lecture was the case study of Ian Cheng in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TO6Luilc4Bo">video</a> which was really interesting for me as it brought together creativity with an AI game simulation which made for interesting outcomes which are not always the same. This makes the art far more interesting in my opinion.

In the workshop we were shown remediation which is a way of taking an old piece of work which an artist had produced, be it a image or a song or anything really, and then bringing it into today’s world or using it in a different form of media. For this task me and Ed talked for a while about what to remediate and we got onto the conversation about me being very interested in VR so we decided that we could remediate an old movie into a full 3D walkable interactable environment. We shared our ideas in the Mural which is below:

The next image is what we developed for this task:

I think that this was a quite interesting activity as it made me think in a different way. The task was quite difficult with the way that we were thinking as it was not possible to make a completely 3D movie that we are able to move around. However I think that the outcome that we created was good and represents the idea well and brings the idea to life.

In my other module we began to look at more authored behaviour AI's and learned about rule-based AIs. The first part of that assignment is to create a rule-based AI. The rule based AI that I have chosen to do is a behaviour tree. In a behaviour tree AI it takes inputs from the enviroment and makes pre-determined dicions based on them. My game is a tower defence game so the AI will look at how many of each type of tower there is in the game and then change which units to send out based on that. The other authored behaviour techniques are finite state machines which are a list of possible states that changes in the environment trigger the AI to go into different states.
