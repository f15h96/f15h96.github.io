The image below is our idea for the reverse engineering task. We have chosen as we have decided on having a dark theme to out game which will be about a morally conflicted hitman who needs to make decisions on how or even whether to kill contracts that are sent to him. As for the developing of the game I am doing the code for the game in Twine, Tom is doing the story and Billy is doing the art as they are they best fit what skills we all have. I think that the game is a really intereresting idea and i'm excited to see how well we can develop it before the end of the sprint.

This week we learnt about time management and how important it is to deliver a project on time. As I have worked in industry before I am very familiar with time management in a project and the difficulties that can come from it if you don't manage the time correctly. This is why using things like Trello or some sort of agile approach is really useful as it allows all the members of the team to know what people are working on and how far through they are in those ta. It also allows the members to rank the tasks by importance so all the team knows what they should do next and in which order. Another very important thing for agile is to have regular meetings which allows the team members to communicate what they have done since the last meeting and what they are planning to do before the next. I am the scrum leader for this project which meant that I was to create the Trello board and to make sure that the board is being updated when people complete their tasks and to organise the regular meeting to discus what we have done and what we are going to do next. 

During the workshop we showed our game in the state that it currently is in as a minimum viable product which had one of the contracts developed and implemented in the game. we didnt have any of the endings as we wanted them to be a surprise for the player and is also why I am not putting the ending in this blog as we want no way for the rest of the class to find out the end to the game. We also had a mural board to review the early stages of the other groups and get some feedback on our game. The image below is the feedback that we receved for the current game.

The feedback for the game was quite good people seemed to like the idea of playing as a villain rather than a hero and people thought that the visuals to this game would be really important. I agree, as it will create the sense of mystery and make the killing ominous and impactful. We also thought about the opposite ideas for the game which is a mental excercise to see what parts we could add or change to the game to improve the ideas that we had by looking at it as a hero. I dont think that this was a very useful excercise for us because of the premise of the game particularly due to the end of the game.
