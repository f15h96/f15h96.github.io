For the reverse engineering task the image shown is what we came up with which we chose as we have decided on having a dark theme to out game which will be about a morrally conflicted hitman which needs to make decistions on how or even whether to kill contracts that are sent to him. As for the developing of the game I am doing the code for the game in twine, Tom is doing the Story and Billy is doing the Art as they are they best fit what skills we all have. I think that the game is a really intereresting idea and im excited to see how well we can develop it before the end of the sprint.
