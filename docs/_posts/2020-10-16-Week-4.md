For the reverse engineering task the image shown is what we came up with which we chose as we have decided on having a dark theme to out game which will be about a morrally conflicted hitman which needs to make decistions on how or even whether to kill contracts that are sent to him. As for the developing of the game I am doing the code for the game in twine, Tom is doing the Story and Billy is doing the Art as they are they best fit what skills we all have. I think that the game is a really intereresting idea and im excited to see how well we can develop it before the end of the sprint.

This week we learnt abut time management and how important it is to deliver a project on time. As I have worked in a company before I am very familiour with time management in a project and the difficalties that can come from it if you dont. This is why  using things like trello or some sort of agile approach is really useful as it allows all the members of the team to know what people are working on and how far through they are in those tasks, it also allows the members to rank the tasks by importance so all the team knows what they should do next and in which order. Another very important thing for agile is to have regular meetings which allows the team members to commulicate what they have done since the last meeting and what they are planning to do before the next. I was the scrum leader for this project which meant that I was to create the trello board and to make sure that the board is being updated when people compleate thair tasks and to organise the regular meeting to discus what we have done. 

During the workshop we showed our game in the state that it currently is in which had one of the contracts developed and implemented in the game, we didnt have any of the endings as we wanted them to be a surprise for the player and is also why I am not putting the ending in this blog as we want no way for the rest of the class to find out the end to the game. We also had a mural board to review the early stages of the other groups and get some feedback on our game. The image below is the feedback that we receved for the current game.

The feedback for the game was quite good people seemed to like the idea of playing as a villain rather than a hero and people thaught that the visuals to this game would be really important which I agree with as it will allow the sence of mystery and make the killing ominous and impactful. We also thaught about the opposite ideas for the game which also is a mental excersise to see what parts we could add or change to the game to make it better from the ideas that we had from the idea on being a hero although I dont think that this was a very useful excersise for us and we didnt take anything from it in my opinion.
