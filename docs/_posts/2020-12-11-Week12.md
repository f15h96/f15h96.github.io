This was the last week of the course and we just had a nice relaxing workshop that we just went over the submission for the assignment for this module. After talking about that we went into a gaming session to see the term out playing among us and skribbl.io. I think that this was a really nice way to end the module, now to finish the assignment.

The contents of this blog is the views and opinions of myself (FH251064) and not of the universities.
