This week in the lecture we learnt about prototyping methods which are a way of trying out how an idea would work in practice without having to go through the effort of making the actual idea in engine so that you can know if the idea works well or not. This is mainly used for rapid ideation which is when you brain storm a load of ideas that you think could work for the concept of the game and then you try them out and see which ones work and then ultimately find out which is the best for the game.

We were also put into our groups for the first sprint of the module. This is a text based game with call and response. I am with Billy and Tom for the sprint but as of yet we dont have an idea for the game. We also have the task of reverse engineering an aspect of a game that we find interesting using the prototyping methods that are in the module guide for this week.

The contents of this blog is the views and opinions of myself (FH251064) and not of the universities.
