In the lecture this week we were talking about creativity something I personally am not great at as I dont think that I am a very creative person. The lecture outlined what different people believe what creativity is to them and that creativity is very diferent depending on who you are. I think that the most interesting part of this lecture was the case study of Ian Cheng in the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TO6Luilc4Bo which was really interesting for me as it braught together creativity with an AI game simulation which made for interesting outcomes which are not always the same making the art far more interesting in my opinion.

In the workshop we were shown remediation which is a way of taking an old piece of work which an artist had produced be it a image or a song or anything really and then bringing it into todays world or using it in a different form of media. For this task we talked a while about what to remediate and we got onto the conversation about me being very interested in VR so we decided that we could remediate an old movie into a full 3d walkable interactable enviroment. What is below is the outcome of this.

In my other module we began to look at more authored behaviour AI's and learned about rule based AI's which are the first part of that assignment which is to create a rule based AI. The rule based AI that i have chosen to do is a behaviour tree which is when you give an AI some different branches and then the AI will execute the different behaviours based on the enviroment which is in my case a tower defence game so the AI will look at how many of each type of tower there is in the game and then change which units to send out based on that. the other authored behaviour tecniques are finite state machines which is when an AI does different actions and then changes what they are doing based on a change in the enviroment which then puts the AI into another state.
