This week we began our sprint 2 which we came up with the idea of a steam punk game where you are a thief with a time machine that allows you to go back X amount of seconds that needs to break into a werehouse that if guarded by a enemy bot and collect pickups to compleate levels allowing you to leave the area and progress to the next level.

In the Workshop this week we only showed the other groups in the class our game as it stands now however we were not ready for this and we did not come with an .exe of out game as none of us saw the email from matt asking that we have one for the workshop. The use for this was to get some testing done and to have some of us do testing for the first time expecially with a game, some of the groups went into the masters suite on campus to play the games in person however I personally didnt. I do think that testing is a really important part of development although I definatly think that even if we had given a copy of the game in its current state there would have been nothing to show and that would not be useful testing.

In the lecture We learned about the importance of comunities and how they can be used to make your games better by keeping the audience in mind and also using these communities to test and get feedback on your game. With this you can then design your game with the people that you want to play it in mind and therefore they are more likely to play the game as thair interests and beliefs align with the games.
