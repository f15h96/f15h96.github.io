This week we compleated the first sprint and the game can be accessed <a href="http://deadmanstale.rf.gd/DMT/DMT3.html">Here</a> we also played all the other games and then we were able to make anm annonomas vote on which game we thaught was the best game. The game meta speak won which was a really polished game considering the time scale that we had to produce the game. We also got feedback on our games which was useful to know where we could have improved but also what we did well which pretty much was that the twist at the end was really good but the morality should have felt more impactful and audio would have been a big addition to the atmosphere of the game.

In the seminar we had a talk from shaz from honey tribe studios which talked to us about his experiences in the industry and the difficalties that he has gone through to get to where he is today. He allowed us to play one of the games that he developed and also asked our opinion on the art style of a new game that he is working on. The talk was quite interesting in allowing me to know the difficalties that new startups have when making thir first game and being able to work with people that you enjoy working with.
