This week we completed the first sprint and the game can be accessed <a href="http://deadmanstale.rf.gd/DMT/DMT3.html">here</a>. We also played all the other games and then we were able to make an anonymous vote on which game we thought was the best game. The game Meta Speak won which was a really polished game considering the time scale that we had to produce the game. We also got feedback on our games which was useful to know where we could have improved but also what we did well. The people said  that the twist at the end was really good but the morality should have felt more impactful and audio would have been a big addition to the atmosphere of the game.

In the seminar we had a talk from Shaz from Honey Tribe Studios who talked to us about his experiences in the industry and the difficulties that he has gone through to get to where he is today. He allowed us to play one of the games that he developed and also asked our opinion on the art style of a new game that he is working on. The talk was quite interesting in allowing me to know the difficulties that new startups have when making their first game and being able to work with people that you enjoy working with. The last thing is a probelem as if the game is not a success you may fall out with the other developers.

The contents of this blog is the views and opinions of myself (FH251064) and not of the universities.
