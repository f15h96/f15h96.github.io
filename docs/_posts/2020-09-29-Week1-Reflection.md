in this week I created my blog and made the avatar which I had as my computer and wrote a personal parragraph which we uploaded to padlet. I feel like these tasks allowed us all to get to know each other a bit and were able to express ourselfs in the way we wanted. This was a good task as no one knew anyone before this and now the class is able to have a bit more normallity with these times as no one can see each other but we can still see that they are just normal people.
