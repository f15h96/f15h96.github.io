in this week I created my blog and made the avatar which I had as my computer and wrote a personal parragraph which we uploaded to padlet. I feel like these tasks allowed us all to get to know each other a bit and were able to express ourselfs in the way we wanted. This was a good task as no one knew anyone before this and now the class is able to have a bit more normallity with these times as no one can see each other but we can still see that they are just normal people.


In my other module I got an introduction to the course and then we started to look at AI and how it has evolved over the years to become more complex. Then we started to look at rule based AI which is when the developer of the AI is able to give the AI rules to follow based on the factors in the enviroment, be it a game level or any other place that the AI is used.
