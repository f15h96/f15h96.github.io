This week we were officially put into our groups for the sprint 1 I am with Billy and Tom. This week we had to do a reverse engineer task that meant that we needed to 
deconstruct a part of a game that we needed to use the prototyping elements that were in the module guide on the game aspect to understand to a more fundemental level what is good about the scene and why it works well.
