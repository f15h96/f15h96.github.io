This week in the lecture we talked about empathy and how empathy is a driving factor in life and can be used in games to make a person care about the characters that are in the game it also was very philosophical in the questioning of good and evil and where the evil in the world comes from whether it be an outside force or from within ourself's. This lecurte was quite interesting to hear the other views on good and evil and how one could improve ones self or use it in a game to create meaning however I didnt really understand the use in exploring this area in the lecture apart from potentially using empathy in the next sprint that we are doing.

For the workshop we looked at different ways to get a player to empathise with the game in a gunshot game that we played in the lecture it didn't really provoke much of an empathetic reaction from me as I just felt that to progress you needed to hit the keys and hitting the keys made the gunshots. We also looked at a case study which mine was case study 2 which was the one that said that someone has an idea about taking 2 mixed ability groups and call one better than the other then see which group performs better. I thaught that this case study was interesting but I thaught was morrally wrong as I think that it will in most cases the people that are told that they are better would perform better, other people in my descussion braught up the point that pertentially they may try harder if they are in the "worse" class but I just think that it would be a unneccisarry experiment that would cause way more damage to the education of the pupils than the good it would cause.

This week I also formed my group for sprint 2 which consisted of Me, Ed, Ross and George. Ross will be doing the art, I will be doing the Unity development, George will be doing the AI and Ed will do the level design.
