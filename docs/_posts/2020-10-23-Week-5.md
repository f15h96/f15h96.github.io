This week is the last week of the development of our game. As for the management of the group I don't think that I have done the best job. However we have worked more as a team compared to a leader telling people what to do which I think is a better way of doing it when there is such a small group like this. So we are all changing the Trello and calling meetings when we have things that we want to discuss as opposed to the idea of having everything set on dates and specific people doing those jobs. The game is coming along quite well and I think that we will be in a good spot to deliver the game in a good state however I do regret not developing the game in Unity.  I think it would be much better if it was developed in Unity as I personally would be much less restricted in what I was able to produce as I am not confident in HTML and CSS. Despite this we chos twine to do this as speed was the most important factor as Twine is made to develop these games quicker and easier. As the game was not assessed the visuals of the game are not as important as the speed of the development. Fortunately I now know how to use Twine and I have refreshed my skills in HTML.

In the lecture this week we looked at reflection and SMART which stand for S – Specific M – Measurable A – Achievable R – Relevant T – Time-bound which highlighted how reflection on one's work is a key point of improvement and how with using agile approaches you need to reflect on what work you have done to decide on what you should then do following that and whether an aspect that has been completed is good enough to be finished or whether you need to improve on it. I personally think that reflection is an important thing and I think that it is quite easy for me to reflect on what I have done however find it quite difficult at times to express how it has affected my thought process or how it has changed the product.
