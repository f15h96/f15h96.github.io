This week is the last week of the development of our game. As for the management of the group I dont think that I have done the best job however we have worked more as a team compared to a leader telling people what to do which I think is a better way of doing it whan there is such a small group like this so we are all changing the trello and calling meetings when we have things that we want to discuss as opposed to the idea of having everything set on dates and specific people doing those jobs. The game is coming along quite well and I think that we will be in a good spot to deliver the game in a good state however I do regret not developing the game in unity as I think that it would be a much better product than what it currently is and I am much more confertable using it compated to twine however we thaught that twine would take less time to develop in.

In the lecture this week we looked at reflection and SMART which stand for S – Specific M – Measurable A – Achievable R – Relevant T – Time-bound which highlighted how reflection on ones work is a key point of improvement and how with using agile approarches you need to reflect on what work you have done to decide on what you should then do following that and whether a aspect that has been compleated is good enough to be done or whether you need to improve on them. I personally think that reflection is an important thing and I think that it is quite easy for me to reflect on what I have done however find it quite difficalt at times to express how they have effected my thaught process or how they have changed the product.
