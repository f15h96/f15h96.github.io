This week in the lecture we learnt about prototyping methods which are a way of trying out how an idea would work in practice without having to go through the effort of making the actual idea in engine so that you can know if the idea works well or not. This is mainly used for rapid ideation which is when you brain storm a load of ideas that you think could work for the cocept of the game and then you try them out and see which ones work and then ultimatly find out which is the best for the game.

We were also put into our groups for the first sprint of the module which has the theme of call and responce and will be a text based game for which I am with Billy and Tom but we dont really have any initial ideas for what the game could be about. We also have the task of reverse engineering an aspect of a game that we find interesting using the prototyping methods that are in the module guide for this week
