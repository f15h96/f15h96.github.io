This week is the last week for us to complete our game and currently it is looking like we are pretty much on track I dont have too many other scripts to wright but the levels and art are not done yet so we are going to have some more meetings over the weekend to make sure that we have everything done to a standard that we are happy with by the deadline. I have been able to do all the scripts asked of me so far except the climbing script so I have said tha we will use jumping insted of climbing as I think it will give a better user experience.

In the lecture this week we talked about the power of wording and the different ways that you can wright things to make the wrighting more powerful in different ways. We also learned a buit more about the agile lefecycle which I think is very useful to know but I have alredy been taught it and then we finnished the lecture talking about how we are supposed to do these blog posts and the document at the end for which I think that I am wrighting these in the way that they are intended to be written in.
