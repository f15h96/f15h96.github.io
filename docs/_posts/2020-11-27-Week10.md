This week is the last week for us to complete our game and currently it is looking like we are pretty much on track. I dont have too many other scripts to write but the levels and art are not done yet so we are going to have some more meetings over the weekend to make sure that we have everything done to a standard that we are happy with by the deadline. I have been able to do all the scripts asked of me so far except the climbing script so I have said that we will use jumping instead of climbing as I think it will give a better user experience.

In the lecture this week we talked about the power of wording and the different ways that you can write things to make the writing more powerful in different ways. We also learned a bit more about the agile lifecycle which I think is very useful to know but I have already been taught it in my undergrad and then we finished the lecture talking about how we are supposed to do these blog posts and the document at the end for which I think that I am writing these in the way that they are intended to be written in.

The contents of this blog is the views and opinions of myself (FH251064) and not of the universities.
