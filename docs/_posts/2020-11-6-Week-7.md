This week in the lecture we learned about systems and the different types of system that there are in the world or in games. We learned that systems are designed to bring structure to things that are chaotic otherwise which is important as without these systems the world would not work in the way that we know it today. With the types of system we learned about real life systems such as a prison system or a road system that allow people to all know what to do without communicating with the other poeple in the same space. We also learned about asthetic systems that are designed systematially to make the viewer question what they are seeing, also game systems which are disigned to make the user have a good experience in the game. I think that systems are really important as they bring meaning and strcuture to sociaty which makes people feel safe and secure in thair day to day life.

We also learned about version control which we will be using for the second sprint when that happnes which I am familiar with as it is a key part of my development in my under grad and also in the time I was working. Version control is used to allow multiple people to work on the same system without the wory of people breaking features that you may have implemented as it allows the users to roll back if something goes wrong and also allows the users to have thair own branch of th eproject and then once they have made some part of the program they can merge that part into the main branch which is finished and then others can only have working builds on thair machine. I am not great at remembering to use version control however I appreciate it is extremely useful expecially for group work.

In the workshop we also did a mural board which we put different systems that we found interesting onto one had to be a culteral or sociatal system and the other a technical or asthetic system. For my systems that I chose I went for the prison system for the culteral one as that was quite interesting when I started to look into it with how organised the life of a prisoner is and what they can expect from a prison in terms of rights and punishments I learned about it <a href="https://www.gov.uk/life-in-prison">here</a>. For the other system I decided to look more about VR/AR as that is a field that I worked in and one that I am really interested. I learned more about the current headsets such as the Hololens 2 for Ar and the vive cosmos which seem to be at the forefront of the field with a bit more compotition in the Vr field as more game companies are interested in making thair own headsets like the valve index a lot of what I looked at are for AR <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/hololens/hardware">here</a> and for VR <a href="https://www.vive.com/us/product/vive-cosmos-elite/overview/">here for the cosmos</a> and <a href="https://www.valvesoftware.com/en/index">here for the Valve index</a>
