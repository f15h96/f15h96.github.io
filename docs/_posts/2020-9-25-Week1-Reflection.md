in this week I created my blog and made the avatar which I had as my computer and wrote a personal parragraph which we uploaded to padlet. I feel like these tasks allowed us all to get to know each other a bit and were able to express ourselfs in the way we wanted. This was a good task as no one knew anyone before this and now the class is able to have a bit more normallity with these times as no one can see each other but we can still see that they are just normal people. We also had to wright a paragraph about what themes and skills that we think that we will need to focus on in the masters and how that may change our work. The following paragraph is my answer:

With my masters I want to better understand how to use AI so that I can create better VR/AR applications that use AI to create a more realistic and immersive experience for the user. The reason that I want to do this is that I have spent quite a lot of time developing different AR/VR applications and I believe that there is a lot of interesting ways that you could incorporate Ai into those applications. The reason that I think it could change the work that I do is that I believe that the future of instructions and games are going to be in VR and AR so if I can master the art of AI with them then I think that it would accelerate my development so that I can create the best applications possible.


In my other module I got an introduction to the course and then we started to look at AI and how it has evolved over the years to become more complex. Then we started to look at rule based AI which is when the developer of the AI is able to give the AI rules to follow based on the factors in the enviroment, be it a game level or any other place that the AI is used.
